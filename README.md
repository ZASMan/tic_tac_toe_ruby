This is a task for the Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

Task:

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

My Approach to solving the problem:
-Started with a basic planning and identifying what I needed: Decided that I needed a game class, a player class, and a human and computer player class which inherits from the player class, loop for control flow, check for winning condition etc.
-Normally I like to apply TDD principles but I didn't quite work that out first.
-Go over the code, try it, refactor and DRY it up whenever possible.

Todo:

-Currently getting an error on running the Computer vs Computer program which I'll have to figure out.
-Run some automatic tests with Rspec, still figuring out the most optimal way to account for the user input gets.chomp variables.
