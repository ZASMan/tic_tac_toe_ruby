This is a task for the Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

Task:

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. I'll also include computer players

As of 12/15/2016 still working on finishing up the engine, and will also write tests. After that, DRY things up and refactor!
