This is a task for the Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

Task:

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. I'll also include computer players

Todo:

-Currently getting an error on running the Computer vs Computer program which I'll have to figure out.
-Run some automatic tests with Rspec, still figuring out the most optimal way to account for the user input gets.chomp variables.
